# Apollo 11 Alarm Analysis

This project aims to analyze the alarm signals from the Apollo 11 mission. Using machine learning techniques such as anomaly detection and NLP, we attempt to detect unknown signals or patterns in the alarm data.

## Project Overview
The project includes:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing alarm data.
2. **Anomaly Detection**: Using Autoencoders to detect anomalies in the alarm signals.
3. **Text Analysis**: Using BERT to analyze text-based alarm descriptions.
4. **Visualization**: Plotting the time-series data to visually inspect alarm patterns.
